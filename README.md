# Hello-World-Cup

Subject : Group results prior to the finals

Fifa World Cup finals have begun, ending the group stage. For 2018 Group-H was the only ambiguous outcome. Both Japan and Senegal had 4 points. (GF-A was also 4 !?!? ) 

Objective: Compute outcomes and find other ambiguities,

After execution of the program we get a list of all possible outcomes. 
For group H[ello] outcome is equal to line 14, which is : 6443, 
	     World
for group  C[up] it is line 27 : (75-31) not an ambiguity 75 qualifies, and 31 is eliminated,
Here are some more:
5442, 5443, 6442, 7441, 9222 ...
There are also 2 super-ambiguous-dramatic results one of them is: 
4444
meaning every team have the same point but only 2 of them qualifies! Fair?
Well that's about all for now, Hope U enjoyed reading readme. I wonder whether Joe Brevin would like it too..
